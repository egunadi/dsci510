Tempe (or "tempeh" in English) are fermented soybean blocks that have gone mainstream in the US as a meat substitute for protein. This is apparent in the bar plot above, where there are more than double the number of restaurants serving tempe-based dishes compared to other Indonesian cuisines.

Here is a list of some tempe dishes available, along with their restaurants. Only restaurants rated greater than or equal to 4.9 are shown:
